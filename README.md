# mephistogram
Histogram arithmetics made easy! 

Simply install with e.g. `pip install .` after download. Have a look at the first example notebook for functionality.
Work in Progress!


Possible issues: 

installation did not work properly and `import mephisto` results in a `ModuleNotFound` error. Try:
* install editable and local with `pip install --user -e .`
* add `/home/you/.../mephistogram/core` to the $PYTHONPATH
